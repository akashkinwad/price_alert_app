## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akashkinwad/price_alert_app.git
   cd price_alert_app
   ```

2. Build and run the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Create Database and run migrations
   ```bash
   docker-compose run app bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:migrate
   ```

4. Create seed data:
  - See the sidekiq console to see the latest price of the coin.
  - Replace 58000 with the price of the coin you want to create an alert for.
  ```bash
  docker-compose run app bundle exec rake "create_user_alerts:create[58000]"
   ```

5. Output Logs
  - Step 4 will print the created user token
  - This will be used in API endpoints

## Solution for Sending Alerts

#### Service Class for Triggering Alerts

A dedicated service class, PriceAlertService, checks whether the current currency price meets the target prices specified by users. Once an alert is triggered, its status is updated, and a list of user_ids is generated for notifying the respective users.
- Process:
  - Fetch all alerts where the coin_name matches and status is created and trigger price.
  - Update the alertâ€™s status to triggered.
  - Collect the relevant user_ids and pass them to a background job for sending email notifications.

#### Asynchronous Email Notifications:
- Email notifications are handled asynchronously via ActiveJob, ensuring the primary application flow remains uninterrupted.
